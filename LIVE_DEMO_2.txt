Abstract

Lab based on collaborative development using Git and GitHub

Team of three students worked on a shared configuration file

Used Git branching, merging, and conflict resolution

One merge conflict was intentionally created and resolved

Final output was documented and analyzed individually

1. Project Objective

Create a shared configuration file (config.txt)

Add environment-specific settings:

Development

Testing

Production

Practice real-world Git workflow

Understand merge conflicts and their resolution

2. Project Setup

Repository initialized by Student 1

Initial config.txt created and pushed to GitHub

Students 2 and 3 cloned the repository

Each student worked on a separate feature branch

3. Team Roles

Student 1 (Lead):

Initialized repository

Added production configuration

Performed final merge and conflict resolution

Student 2:

Added test environment configuration

Performed clean merge

Student 3:

Added development configuration

Created intentional merge conflict

4. Git Workflow Followed

Repository cloning

Feature branch creation

Independent development on branches

Commit and push changes

Merge branches into main

Resolve merge conflict manually

5. Collaborative Development Process
Student 2 – Test Configuration

Created feature-test branch

Added test-specific settings

Committed and pushed changes

Merged branch into main without conflict

Student 3 – Development Configuration

Created feature-dev branch

Added development settings

Modified version number

Pushed changes without merging

Student 1 – Production Configuration

Created feature-prod branch

Added production settings

Modified the same version line

Merge caused conflict

Conflict resolved manually

6. Merge Conflict Resolution

Conflict detected during merge

Same version line modified in two branches

Conflict markers identified in file

Correct version selected manually

All environment settings retained

Changes committed and pushed

7. Version Control Log

Maintained record of Git commands

Included:

Repository initialization

Branch creation

Commits

Merges

Conflict resolution

Ensured traceability of all changes

8. Literature Review (Summary Points)

Branching allows parallel development

Main branch remains stable

Maintainers review and approve changes

Merge conflicts improve coordination

Conflict resolution strengthens collaboration

Git improves accountability and transparency

9. Critical Analysis
Student 1

Identified merge conflict

Edited conflicting lines manually

Removed conflict markers

Committed resolved file

Pushed final version

Student 2

Fast-forward merge occurs when no conflicts exist

Main branch directly moves forward

Results in clean commit history

Student 3

Conflict detected during merge attempt

Same line edited by multiple users

Stable version selected

All configurations preserved

10. Conclusion

Lab provided real-world Git experience

Improved understanding of collaboration

Learned branch management and conflict handling

Highlighted importance of teamwork

Strengthened version control skills
